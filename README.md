## About Me ##
I'm a Coastal Florida denizen, the first and only Web Content Editor at Flagler College, and a long-time journalist and travel guide author. I know lots about content (I am immersed in it) but almost nothing about code. I love to learn, and that's why I'm here! Because I have no existing knowledge to lean on, this is kind of a risk for me since I'm a type-A person who always has to get that 100. I think this class will be a learning experience on all fronts - not just academically, but for me as a person. I hope to learn to tolerate the discomfort of being clueless in an academic arena. (But still get that good grade, because this is a master's course, after all!) 
## Past Coding Experience ##
I've seldom used code, except when editing text in a CMS and the text is behaving strangely for a reason I can't see, such as extra spaces or weird indent. Then, I'll go to inspect source and look for obvious HTML issues like a paragraph that shouldn't be there, and I'll remove it.
## Career Goals ##
1. To add knowledge and skills I can use daily in my role.
2. To complete a graduate certificate in Web Design toward this end, because our Web team numbers exactly two, including me, and we need all the skills we can aquire.
3. To finish my master of mass communication with a concentration in digital strategy.
4. To move up in my organization or find a higher role elsewhere.
